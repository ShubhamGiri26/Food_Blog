        <h2>Welcome to My Food Blog!</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I’m Shubham, a college student with a deep love for food and cooking. This site is my little corner of the internet where I share my passion for all things culinary. 
          Whether you’re here to find quick college-friendly recipes or to explore some gourmet ideas, you’re in the right place!</p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>My Food Blog started as a project during my 4th year at JMIT college. As a student juggling classes and exams, I realized the importance of good food that’s easy to make and doesn’t break the bank. 
          What began as a hobby has now grown into a platform where I share my favorite recipes, cooking tips, and food adventures with you.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recipes:</strong> From quick dorm-room snacks to easy-to-make meals, our recipes are designed to be simple, tasty, and budget-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong> Learn the basics of cooking, meal prepping, and kitchen hacks that every college student should know.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Adventures:</strong> Join me as I explore local eateries, campus food spots, and share my food journeys with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Community:</strong> Connect with fellow students, share your cooking experiences, and get advice in our friendly community forums.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Food is not just about eating; it’s about connecting, learning, and enjoying every bite. At My Food Blog, we believe that everyone deserves delicious, homemade meals, no matter how busy life gets. Our goal is to inspire you to cook, share, and enjoy every meal with passion and creativity.</p>
